this guy explain it correctly you can do it by your self

you can use burpsuit to 
- intercept HTTP traffic 
- you can modify requests which is the much benefial thing in it.
  - so I learned in this lesson how to modify request that is sent to the server through it
- also set the targer scope you want to see on burp suit 
- also I learned how to reissue the requests with Burp repeater -> you send the request after you change something in then you see the output of server
    whether it's 200 or 500 or 401 or 403..
still learning
