Sql injection attacks;
  - it's an attack that attacker used to extract data of users inside the program and compromise the servers or the backend of the program 
  - it may be done using denial of service attack
  - as I said above it's impact as you know;
    - extract the data of the users like; passwords,credit cards...
how to detect sql injection
as you know  ; you need to test the software to see whehter it has a weaknesses or not
there are some tests you can submit into the application to see;  
  1. single quote '  and look for error
  2. some sql commands 
  3. boolean conditions like; OR 1=1 ..
Most cases that SQL  injections accours are;
1. in where statements
2. select statements
3. insert statements
4. Update statements


now we used SQL injection to extract; hidden data from the website
ex;
https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--  -> here we added '-- 
-- -> is a comment in sql which means the restrication after that query make it comment and run this query instead 

this is the query behine the scene;
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Gifts'--'
AND released = 1;
after you implement this query it will appear as you see;
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Gifts'
no released restrication
ex'
https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts' OR 1=1--

1=1 => true -> which means  choose any items from the table called products either it's categpry called Gifts or any one(true)
the query behined the scene;
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Gifts'
OR 1=1--'
AND released = 1; 

category = 'Gifts'
OR
1 = 1
for the first lab ; 
the problem ;
 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products



here are the solution;
https://0a3a00f5049a1016809fdfd600b000fd.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Gifts%27+or+1=1--
I added '+or+1=1+-- 
this is the next test that you can add to make a sql injection into the lab 
note that ; '-- didn't show the whole items in the database so we used the other condition
